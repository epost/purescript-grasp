* What is Grasp?

Grasp, short for GRAph Specification Processor, allows you to:

- Specify graphs in a super concise format.
- Export graph structure to many other formats.
- Leave formatting (layout, colouring, etc.) to other tools, such as GraphViz.

Some points of comparison to give you an idea:

|                                     | grasp                        | GraphViz             |
|-------------------------------------+------------------------------+----------------------|
| syntax                              | concise                      | a bit faffy at times |
| semantics                           | anything                     | visual               |
| nodes and edges have                | optional type annotations    | visual markup        |
| export to                           | anything; see export formats | graphics formats     |
| higher graphs (edges between edges) | TODO                         | no                   |

* Examples

Syntax is inspired by both GraphViz and Cypher:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# concise node and edge syntax

a -> b
b -> c; c -> d
d, e, f -> g

# labeled edges

1 -succ-> 2

# type annotations

x:A -f-> y:B
y -g:G-> z

# function application syntax

x -f(x)-> y
x -> f(x)
x:A -f(x)-> y:B
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Export formats

Work on implementing these is ongoing:

- [X] GraphViz
- [X] PlantUML sequence diagram
- [ ] Datalog, Prolog, other logic programming languages
- [ ] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_Query_Language][Cypher]] (Neo4j and others)
- [ ] JSON
- [ ] CSV
- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] org-table
- [ ] vis.js

* Features

- [X] no formatting, only structure
- [ ] higher graphs (arrows between arrows)
- [ ] comma syntax: ~a,b,c -> d, e~
- [X] type syntax? ~a:A - b:B -> c:C~
- [X] function application syntax: ~x -> f(x) -> y~
- [ ] ports (needed for string diagrams, among others)
- [ ] comments
- [ ] transitive syntax? ~a -> b -> c -> d~
- [ ] reverse and bidirectional arrows?
- [ ] allow (back)slash in node / edge labels? (handy for paths and URLs)?
- [ ] quoted node / edge labels?
- [ ] dash as part of identifiers (but without conflicts or ambiguities)
- [ ] question mark as part of identifiers?
- [ ] node / edge ids? maybe using hash mark?
- [ ] allow references: graph transformations, styling, comments, legend, etc
